# Coastal hazard and tsunami risk mapping

The project presents a comprehensive tsunami hazard analysis for nuclear power plants along the western coast of India, using numerical simulations based on a potential Great Makran Earthquake (M9.0). The study integrates geospatial datasets, numerical modelling, and data visualization to evaluate the potential tsunami impacts, including arrival times, run-up heights, and wave propagation.
